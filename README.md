# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis: Keys to Successful Projects

The mission of this project was to identify certain factors that lend Kickstarter campaigns to be successful - or failures - by analyzing data from over 4,000 campaigns in Excel. 

Using pivot tables, statistical formulas and graphic charts, I was able to make a number of conclusions summarized in the Word document in this folder. 

The analysis is presented in the Excel file in the various tabs. 

I invite your feedback!
