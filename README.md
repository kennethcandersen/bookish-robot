# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis: Keys to Successful Projects

The mission of this project was to identify certain factors that lend Kickstarter campaigns to be successful - or failures - by analyzing data from over 4,000 campaigns in Excel.

Kickstarter the global leader crowdfunding, helping project owners raise over $2 billion in capital. However, only a third of 300,000+ projects launched on Kickstarter have reached their fundraising goals. This analysis provides insights on why some projects are statistically more likely to succeed. 

Using pivot tables, statistical formulas and graphic charts, my conclusions summarized in the PDF document in this folder. The full analysis is presented in the Excel file in the various tabs. 

I invite your feedback!
